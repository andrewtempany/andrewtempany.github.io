          <p class="main-text">   <h3> What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>

            <ol>
                <li> I'm quick to judge myself. I suspect that this isn't unique to myself, but at some point in every week I found myself questioning whether I could do this. I think that this is a self-defence mechanism, to realise that I don't really know what I'm doing, it makes me uncomfortable and I don't like it, maybe I should stop.</li>
                <li> I can learn anything I want, given the right mindset and enough energy that I need to put into it. I've had a few moments over the last 5 weeks where I've convinced myself that a task is beyond me, so I look up a solution, read about how it's done and find it simpler than I expected and the next time I try to do it, I can piece it together just fine. I've proven myself wrong quite a few times and that feels pretty good.</li>
                <li> How much fun can be had solving, what is essentially mathematical problems. That said, they can be maddening as well. </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3> What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming? </h3>
            
                <p>Being aware of human interaction with code is critical to code. To make it readable to other devs and accessible as many possible users. A team of devs will catch a lot more bugs and make a far more streamlined program, so having an awareness of other people taking part in the coding process, and needing to follow a formatting structure plays a big part in it. <br><br>
            
            I think that in terms of learning, being able to collaborate and learn from others at a similar level as myself can help fill gaps in my knowledge in a way that sets a solid foundation to buildi upon. For this to work well, you need to be able to communicate clearly and work with your other cohort members.</p>
            
            <h3> What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </h3>
            
                <p> How difficult it's been. I've always considered myself to be quite emotionally intelligent, but going through the core excercises and learning about myself and EQ as a concept, I've had a few realisations that I can be very aware of other people, but I'm often completely oblivious when it comes to being able to identify and make use of my own emotions and qualities.</p> 
            
            <h3> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h3>
            
                <p> Strangely, something in my subconscious tries to distract me or shut me off when I start trying to self-analyse, I can spend 8 hours working in a day and get through most of the week's tech activities (or I could towards the start of the foundations curriculum) but when it came to the core excercises i could spend 8 hours and by then end of it I would have written 3 paragraphs. I think it's definitely a skill to work on. If I can't self-analyse to try and figure out what I need to change most about myself, I'll never become the person that I want to be.</p>
            
            <h3> Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course? </h3>
            
                <p>I'm no expert but from what I've learnt here and from what I've read and learnt in my own experience, technical ability seems to be a basic hurdle requirement for a job, that's the obvious thing that people need to learn, but the EQ and people skills are what make a great candidate. A culture of a team can make or break a project just like technical ability can.</p>
            
            <h3> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer. </h3>
            
                <p> Definitely doesn't feel like a waste of time. I think the fact that I found it so difficult, is reason enough to say that I should probably try and set aside time, more regularly, for introspection and to work on myself and my EQ rather than just hard skills. The best learning happens outside of our comfort zone.</p>
