          <p class="main-text">   <h3> What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>

            <ol>
                <li> I'm quick to judge myself. I suspect that this isn't unique to myself, but at some point in every week I found myself questioning whether I could do this. I think that this is a self-defence mechanism, to realise that I don't really know what I'm doing, it makes me uncomfortable and I don't like it, maybe I should stop.</li>
                <li> I can learn anything I want, given the right mindset and enough energy that I need to put into it. I've had a few moments over the last 5 weeks where I've convinced myself that a task is beyond me, so I look up a solution, read about how it's done and find it simpler than I expected and the next time I try to do it, I can piece it together just fine. I've proven myself wrong quite a few times and that feels pretty good.</li>
                <li> How much fun can be had solving, what is essentially mathematical problems. That said, they can be maddening as well. </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3> What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming? </h3>
            
            <p>Being aware of human interaction with code is critical to code. To make it readable to other devs and accessible as many possible users. A team of devs will catch a lot more bugs and make a far more streamlined program, so having an awareness of other people taking part in the coding process, and needing to follow a formatting structure plays a big part in it. <br><br>
            
            I think that in terms of learning, being able to collaborate and learn from others at a similar level as myself can help fill gaps in my knowledge in a way that sets a solid foundation to buildi upon. For this to work well, you need to be able to communicate clearly and work with your other cohort members.</p>
            
            <h3> What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </h3>
            
            <p> How difficult it's been. I've always considered myself to be quite emotionally intelligent, but going through the core excercises and learning about myself and EQ as a concept, I've had a few realisations that I can be very aware of other people, but I'm often completely oblivious when it comes to being able to identify and make use of my own emotions and qualities.</p> 
            
            <h3> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h3>
            
            <p> Strangely, something in my subconscious tries to distract me or shut me off when I start trying to self-analyse, I can spend 8 hours working in a day and get through most of the week's tech activities (or I could towards the start of the foundations curriculum) but when it came to the core excercises i could spend 8 hours and by then end of it I would have written 3 paragraphs. I think it's definitely a skill to work on. If I can't self-analyse to try and figure out what I need to change most about myself, I'll never become the person that I want to be.</p>
            
            <h3> Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course? </h3>
            
            <p>I'm no expert but from what I've learnt here and from what I've read and learnt in my own experience, technical ability seems to be a basic hurdle requirement for a job, that's the obvious thing that people need to learn, but the EQ and people skills are what make a great candidate. A culture of a team can make or break a project just like technical ability can.</p>
            
            <h3> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer. </h3>
            
            <p> Definitely doesn't feel like a waste of time. I think the fact that I found it so difficult, is reason enough to say that I should probably try and set aside time, more regularly, for introspection and to work on myself and my EQ rather than just hard skills. The best learning happens outside of our comfort zone.</p>
            
            
            <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

            <p>I don't have a particular goal or career pathway that I want to see eventuate after bootcamp. I havent decided whether I want to go into front-end or back-end. I havent even decided whether I want to be a web developer or a game developer. I think what I can say though is that I want to see where my strengths lie initially and make more educated decisions based on myself and my opportunities.</p>

            <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>

            <p>In a study environment I would usually say that my biggest limitation or threat to my studies would be procrastination, however I've always been good and alert in classes and workshops so I feel like the EDA approach of on-campus full-time learning will suit me well. I think the thing that I'll battle with through this is my own self-talk and making sure that I keep it positive. <br><br>
            In terms of strengths, I really like and thrive when I'm working on a team. I'm very excited to work in teams and learn how I can make the most positive impact I can on a team and a project. </p>

            <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>

            <p>As I mentioned in the previous question, I'm excited to learn to give the best of myself in a team. I think theres a lot of aspects to that goal and it's not something that can be developed in 10 weeks but learning to make team decisions and personally finding that balance between decisive and not overbearing or disengaged with a team or project, making sure that I am actively contributing to a group and helping keep culture positive.</p>

            <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>

            <p>I expect myself to push myself daily. That means staying alert in a way that I can learn and take in the necessary information. That means to make sure that I understand each topic discussed to a minimum level and feeling able to go learn more of the topic by myself in my own time. Strangely, I feel like being able to be a part of a conversation on each topic and not get lost is how I would define my minimum level of understanding, I'm probably not going to test that but thats how I'm measuring that.  </p>

            <h3>Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>

            <p> Here is what I wrote in week 2:<br>
            My commitment is that I will make this bootcamp a conscious learning experience. I will be deliberate in the notes that I take and the time that I spend working so as to not waste time or procrastinate. I want to be a positive influence on others around me and not complain. 

            <br><br>
            I'm going edit and clarify this coming into bootcamp.</p>
            <h3>My commitment.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm going to take notes with a goal of creating a cheatsheet/poster with a clear explanation and essential information of each technical topic in bootcamp</li>
                <li>I'm going to remain positive about my learning and keep my language positive with the people around me. No self-deprecating humour, no questioning my learning, I can do this.</li>
                <li>Lastly, I want to add that I want to have positive learning experiences with the other students in the cohort. Rather than focusing on MY learning, I want to learn WITH the others. I'm not sure that that will make a physical difference on my learning experience but I hope it will make a psychological difference.</li>

            </ul>
