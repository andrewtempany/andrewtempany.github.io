            <h2>Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset.</h2> 
            <img src="images/Neuroplasticity.jpg" class="melbourne">

<h3> Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
             <p>When we learn, we create new pathways between neurons in our brains. We often get caught in a trap of saying "I'm good at X but I'm terrible at Y" and that becomes a fixed concept to us. Neuroplasticity means that "even though I'm currently terrible at Y, I can learn about it and get better at it, it isn't something that I have to live with forever. I am not the issue, I just haven't been exposed to it enough". The value of understanding Neuroplasticity is that anyone can learn anything. </p>

<h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit.
</h3>
             <p>As I'm currently learning to code as a part of the Enspiral Dev Academy, understanding neuroplasticity allows me to get past self doubts and negativity in my learning process. Proficiency with a skill doesnt happen in 2 weeks. 
</p>

<h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
</h3>
            <ul> 
                <li>Get enough quality sleep.</li>
                <li>Keep active and excercise.</li>
                <li>Find purpose in what you're doing.</li>
                <li>Read books.</li>
            </ul>     
            <p>I found a lot of this here: <br>
              - https://thriveglobal.com/stories/how-to-improve-your-neuroplasticity/
<br>
             I found this site quite helpful in that it provides real things that you can actively keep on top of to improve neuroplasticity. </p>
            
             
<h3>Discuss what is a Growth Mindset and why it is relevant
</h3>
             <p>I found this image at <a>https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/Impact</a> and so credit goes to them.
             I learn best visually and so this was an awesome, simple and clear way to explain the value and characteristics of a growth mindset.</p>

<h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
</h3>
             <ul>
                 <li>Celebrate growth with others. This will mean giving honest and true praise to others in my cohort and being able to accept it when it's given to  me.</li>
                 <li>Emphasise growth over speed. recognise that I won't be the fastest to learn if I want to learn it well. I will and should make mistakes to grow from them.</li>
                 <li>Be realistic in my expectations of myself. Its going to take a lot longer than this bootcamp for me to be a brilliant developer but it will give me a strong start and help me find a growth path.</li>
             
             </ul>

             <p>Similar to the link I shared about neuroplasticity, <a href="https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/features/develop-a-growth-mindset/">
                  this website (https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/features/develop-a-growth-mindset/
) </a> provides a great list of ways to implement a growth mindset in a tangible way.</p>
