<h3> What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
             <p>At this stage I'm still figuring out how I want my career to turn out. Not so long ago I wanted to be an architect, but the last two or so years have changed that. For now I'm excited to learn to code and to work at that for the next 5 -10 years, and then go from there</p>

<h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
             <p>I would like to work on being able to analyse myself and my work from a more objective point of view. I find it difficult to list my strengths or qualities for example and that makes it difficult to improve myself if I can't determine what I need to work on most.</p>

<h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>
             <p>well.. damn.<br>
             As for strengths:</p>
            <ul> 
                <li>I enjoy languages.</li>
                <li>I am patient</li>
                <li>I am honest</li>
                <li>I get genuinely excited to design things</li>
            </ul>     
            <p>Limitations:</p>
             <ul> 
                 <li>Tend to dive into a task with no plan and end up confusing myself half-way through.</li>
                 <li>I avoid conflict and don't deal very well with it.</li>
                 <li>If I don't consciously check myself, I procrastinate.</li>
             </ul>
             
<h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
             <p>My commitment is that I will make this bootcamp a conscious learning experience. I will be deliberate in the notes that I take and the time that I spend working so as to not waste time or procrastinate. I want to be a positive influence on others around me and not complain.</p>

<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
             <p>I talk about everything with my wife. She is my first point of contact with any problems that I have, she helps me calm down and think about how I can solve said issue. Following that, if still feel like I need help solving an issue, I will contact dev staff and move from there. </p>

<h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
             <p>I expect them to respond to my questions in a somewhat timely way and not leave me stuck on an issue for three days. I expect the courtesy from them that they deserve from us.</p>
