<h3>What is EQ</h3>
<p>Emotional Intelligence or EQ (the Q stands for "Quotient") is the ability to identify and respond to emotions in yourself and in others. Salovey and Mayer further define it as:<br>
"the ability to monitor one's own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior".
<br><br>
    They broke this down further into these 4 abilities as a way of measuring EQ:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Perceiving emotions – the ability to detect and decipher emotions in faces, pictures, voices, and cultural artifacts—including the ability to identify one's own emotions. Perceiving emotions represents a basic aspect of emotional intelligence, as it makes all other processing of emotional information possible.</li>
<li>Using emotions – the ability to harness emotions to facilitate various cognitive activities, such as thinking and problem-solving. The emotionally intelligent person can capitalize fully upon his or her changing moods in order to best fit the task at hand.</li>
<li>Understanding emotions – the ability to comprehend emotion language and to appreciate complicated relationships among emotions. For example, understanding emotions encompasses the ability to be sensitive to slight variations between emotions, and the ability to recognize and describe how emotions evolve over time.</li>
             <li>Managing emotions – the ability to regulate emotions in both ourselves and in others. Therefore, the emotionally intelligent person can harness emotions, even negative ones, and manage them to achieve intended goals.</li></ul>

<h3>EQ vs IQ</h3>

<p>EQ - Identifying, evaluating, controling and expressing ones own emotions; perceiving, and assessing others' emotions; using emotions to facilitate thinking, understanding emotional meanings.
<br><br>
IQ
Ability to learn, understand and apply information to skills, logical reasoning, word comprehension, math skills, abstract and spatial thinking, filter irrelevant information.
<br><br>

They are similar in that they are all about processing information, the difference comes in the type of information and it's sources.
IQ is all about academic learning, understanding and correlating information.
EQ is about identifying and responding to emotions in oneself and in others to get the best out of people and situations.
